# About

This is the basic info home-page of Izzi Ink, a personal web-site that will eventually be turned into a JAM-stack based blog, pending what I learn on my journey to master React. or Remix or all or both.
For now I focus on mastering the core concepts related to CSS.

## TODO

- Add About section
